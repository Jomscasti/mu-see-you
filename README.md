# MUSEEYOU 🎨❤️

**MUSEEYOU** is your personal museum — a digital space that celebrates love, memory, and the art of living. The name blends *Museum*, *See*, and *You*, reflecting the core idea: a space where you see and feel your story unfold like curated art.

## ✨ Project Overview

MUSEEYOU is a love-centered interactive website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap 5**. It offers a visual and emotional experience through:

- 📷 **Gallery Cards** showcasing love as a journey.
- 🖼️ **Monthly Highlights** featuring curated images per chapter.
- 🎞️ **Narrative Viewer** that brings each story part to life.
- 🎥 **Video Modal** embedded seamlessly for storytelling.
- 🌐 **Responsive design** with mobile-first layout.
